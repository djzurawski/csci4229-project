Rotating Bicycle wheel with reflective sidewall.

Pretty straight forward. Rim sidewalls look reflective but not real reflections. 
Axle threading uses two sided lighting. Spent a lot of time trying to get shadows but I
could not wrap my head around it, and what I did get working was not right at all.

 *  arrows     Change view angle
 *  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
 *  a/d        Rotate wheel along x-axis
 *  w/s        Rotate wheel along y-axis
 *  < >        Move Camera along x-axis 
 *  Home,End   Move Camera along z-axis
 *  / '        move Camera along y-axis
